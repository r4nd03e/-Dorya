<!--Hiiii!! Wishing you all the best my love. You've grown so damn much ever since and 
its not only evident by the amount of white hairs on you hehe; But just how- goddamn
mature and sensible you've been for the growing months. I hope you don't lose your
spark and goof as the years keep piling on. And this may be another great year of 
existence for you!! Wowzers!! Old man!! Grandpa!! But jokes aside, you're such a 
godsend lmao. I love you dearly and I can't wait to spend the rest of your birthdays
with you! teehee :3 OH! and also DORYA DORYA DORYA or smth. Anyways this gift took a while
sorry, got hella busy, but I'll always make time for my beloved. Also here's a stupid ass
poem I wrote for you during break cause I can't stop thinking about you (and ultrakill)

A gentle soothing rain
Leaves felt on land
Sun's embracing horizon blue
And the smell of coffe in a quiet morning

My favorite playlist
The scattered ink on the paper
Rainbows in sunshower
A bee's noisy wing

You, both peace and chaos combined
The laughter we share
The sadness we overcome
The hugs we recieve
The banter we incite
The connections we build
The crimes we committed

Oh how I love your entropy
You're the wash of colors in my life <3
